AI used to help is Chatgpt. And this helped me with the coding since I have no experience in coding a website and insteractive buttons while also brushing up on my coding knowlegde
The AI also helped me catch any errors that I missed by putting the code in Chatgpt. One of the challenges was figureing out what business to use and figuring out the code to use. Since I put the code in Chatgpt and used the result with the corrections and additions the entire index and style would be considered AI written. I will stand by this so if the code is flagged as copy and paste that is the reason why. 
I learned tha using AI for coding is helpful for if you don't know how to code for a specific thing like how I did't know what codes to use for a website and for checking for any errors by puting the code in and asking the AI to check for errors.
